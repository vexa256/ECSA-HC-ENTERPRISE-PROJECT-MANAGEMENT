i have a question based on this database data and logic , how can we create a Regional Results Framework Report that combines the scores of all entities excluding ECSA-HC and IGAD, that report on RRF indicators , keeping in mind RRF indicators are indicators stored in the indicators table but have no valid EntityID meaning they are not attached to a given reporting entity but rather have a hard coded EntityID called RRF , the task is create the above report , where a user is asked to select the year , and if the  logged in user has an AccountRole of Admin and UserType MPA, they can access a a report on all entities otherwise if the AccountRole is not Admin but he UserType is MPA then they can only see a report on their entities performance stored in their EntityID field, the goal is to have a report that calculates the performance of RRF indicators to come up with one regional dashboard that shows an accumulated value  computed based on
