1. Entity “Scorecard” or “Dashboard” Reports
What it shows
For a chosen EntityID (e.g., “KENYA” or “BURUNDI”), display all relevant indicators in a single listing, including:

The Indicator name
The Baseline or starting value
Latest achieved or most recently reported value
The target for this period (e.g., “TargetYearTwo2025”)
A quick status (On Track / Behind / Exceeded)
Why it’s useful
This is a standard executive summary for each entity’s performance. It answers: “How is Country X currently doing across all the indicators it is supposed to report?”




Indicator vs. Target Over Time (Trend)
What it shows
For a given Entity (or region) and a specific indicator, plot or table out each year/period’s:

Baseline PAD 2023
Baseline 2024
Target Year One 2024
Target Year Two 2025
…
Achieved value (from mpa_reports.Response) – if stored per period
The difference or percentage gap relative to the target
Why it’s useful
It shows whether the entity is consistently moving toward the target over multiple years (2024–2030). This is a classic time‐series analysis: “Are we trending up? On track for 2026? Or lagging behind?”




3. Comparison of Multiple Entities on a Single Indicator
What it shows
Pick a single indicator (e.g., “% of project-supported laboratories that achieved a 3-star rating or higher…”) and compare how each country is doing in the same year. For instance, a table/graph:

Entity	2025 Target	2025 Actual	Performance (%)
KENYA	80.0	62.5	78% of target
RWANDA	80.0	75.0	94% of target
BURUNDI	80.0	40.0	50% of target
ETHIOPIA	80.0	70.0	88% of target
Why it’s useful
Stakeholders can see cross‐country or cross‐region performance for a single crucial indicator. This is especially important for RRF indicators that are region‐wide.




5. Time‐Series “Achievements vs. Baseline” for a Single Entity
What it shows
A historical timeline for a single entity, focusing on changes in a certain CRF indicator from:

Baseline PAD 2023
Baseline 2024
Year 1 (2024) Achieved vs. Target
Year 2 (2025) Achieved vs. Target
Etc.
Why it’s useful
A country wants to see if it’s improved from baseline to subsequent years. The schema’s columns (BaselinePAD2023, Baseline2024, TargetYearOne2024, etc.) make this easy to chart.




6. RRF “League Table” for Partner Countries
What it shows
For an RRF indicator (like “Countries that have developed a RCCE plan…”), produce a table ranking each country’s reported status. For example:

RWANDA – Yes
KENYA – Yes
ETHIOPIA – No
BURUNDI – No
Why it’s useful
Regional bodies (e.g., ECSA‐HC, IGAD) can see at a glance which countries have implemented that RRF requirement and which have not, enabling them to focus resources where needed.
